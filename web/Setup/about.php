			<p>
			    I'm currently an MIT senior taking a semester off to continue my summer internship doing IT
			    consulting. I'm planning on graduating next semester with majors in 8 and 18 as well as minors 
			    in 14 and 15 (that's physics, math, econ, and management respectively for non-MITers). One of 
			    my hobbies is coding and learning as many programming languages as I can. So far I've worked 
			    (at least briefly) with Java, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, Python, C, MatLab, LaTex, as well as others.
			    I don't really have an end goal with all of it, but so far the programming experience has 
			    helped in both school and work and I enjoy it, so I'll continue. I'm also open to any suggested 
			    features, so please leave a comment in the bugs/features section and I'll do my best to 
			    incorporate it.
