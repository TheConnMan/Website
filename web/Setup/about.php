	I had this connect four game as a Java program and I decided to
	put it in some HTML as Javascript. Maybe there will be a chess game at some point, but 
	that seems like it would take a lot of work to code. I rather put in some database stuff 
	using MySQL and try some cyber security stuff. The colors and designs need some work too. 
	Stay tuned for more.
